**Introduction to Olympic Data**

The aim of my independent project was to apply what I have learned in class to areas of data analysis that interest me. Sports is a field that heavily relies on data. Data is especially prominent in the case of the Olympics, which incorporates different countries competing throughout history. Many people take pride in the amount of success their country, or an individual athlete see at this stage. We will be taking a look at the two most historically dominant countries in the Olympics, and compare them in the sports they succeed in most. In addition, we will compare male and female athletes of these countries to see if there is any edge between them. 

**Subfolder Components:**

-   [Data:](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Independent_Project_Bonilla/blob/main/Independent_Folder/Data/olympics.csv) Olympics data used
-   [Output:](Independent_Project_Bonilla/Independent_Folder/Output at main · Biol551-CSUN/Independent_Project_Bonilla (github.com)) Plots used for country and sex comparison   
-   [Scripts:](Independent_Project_Bonilla/Independent_Folder/Scripts at main · Biol551-CSUN/Independent_Project_Bonilla (github.com)) RMarkdown and HTML scripts used

**Libraries Used:**

- **Tidyverse:** used for plotting.

- **KableExtra:** used for making tables. 
- **ymlthis:** used to write "yamal" for rmarkdown. 
- **dplyr:** used for structuring tables and count functions. 
- **patchwork:** used for combining plots to compare. 
- **ggplot2:** used for plotting
- **prettydoc:** used for making the rmarkdown prettier.
